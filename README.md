A software prototype that replaces physical taxi meters with a fully digital system, built as a pilot project for TaxiTech Solutions' operations team.

## 📋 Project Context

TaxiTech Solutions has used physical Hale T200 taximeters since 2018. The manufacturer discontinued support in 2023, and devices are starting to fail across the fleet. This project is a functional prototype to validate a 100% software-based replacement before committing budget to an external vendor.

## ✨ Features

- Real-time fare calculation based on vehicle state (stopped / moving)
- Configurable tariffs via a JSON file, no code changes required
- Trip history persisted in a SQLite database for data integrity and structured queries
- Daily trip history with total earnings summary
- Password-protected access with hashed credentials (no plaintext passwords)
- Screen lock feature, so passengers cannot tamper with the meter mid-ride
- Two interfaces: a command-line app for the driver's console and a mobile/tablet-friendly web app
- REST API backing the web app, reusable by any future client
- Activity logging for auditability
- Unit tests for the fare calculation logic

## 💶 Current Tariffs (EMT Madrid Zone, June 2025)

| Status | Rate |
|---|---|
| Stopped or speed < 20 km/h | €0.02/second |
| Moving | €0.05/second |

Rates are editable in `config/tarifas.json` without touching the code.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture:

- `src/domain/` — core business logic (`Carrera`, `Tarifa`), independent of any interface or storage detail
- `src/infrastructure/` — technical support (logging, persistence, authentication)
- `src/interfaces/` — entry points (`cli.py` for the command line, `web.py` for the Flask web/API app)

## 🛠️ Technical Decisions

- **Flask**: lightweight enough for a prototype, no unnecessary boilerplate, and lets the same business logic (`domain/`) power both the CLI and the web app without duplication.
- **SQLite**: no external database server to install or configure, fits the single-command deployment requirement, and still gives relational integrity and structured queries — enough for a pilot with one vehicle.
- **Layered architecture** (`domain` / `infrastructure` / `interfaces`): keeps business rules independent of any specific interface or storage technology, so either can be replaced (e.g. SQLite → PostgreSQL, or adding a mobile client) without touching the fare logic.
- **Conda**: consistent, reproducible environment across development machines.

## ⚙️ Setup

1. Create and activate the conda environment:
```
conda create -n taximetro python=3.x
conda activate taximetro
```
2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

Run the entire application with a single command:

​```
pip install -r requirements.txt && python -m src.interfaces.web
​```

The server starts at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. No manual environment configuration is needed beyond having Python and pip installed. Trip data persists in `data/historial.db` (SQLite) across restarts.

## ▶️ Usage

### Command-line interface
```
python -m src.interfaces.cli
```
Menu options: start trip, change state (stopped/moving), end trip and charge, view today's history, exit, lock the app.

### Web app (recommended for tablet/mobile use)
```
python -m src.interfaces.web
```

By default the server runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5000` and is also reachable from other devices on the same WiFi network at `http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:5000`. Find your local IP with:

- macOS: `ipconfig getifaddr en0`
- Linux: `hostname -I`
- Windows: `ipconfig` (look for "IPv4 Address" under your active network adapter)

On first load you'll be asked for the access password (numeric keypad on mobile). From the main screen you can start a trip, switch between stopped/moving, end the trip, view the daily history with total earnings, and lock the screen.

## 🔌 REST API

All endpoints require an authenticated session (login via `/login` first).

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/carrera/iniciar` | Start a new trip |
| POST | `/api/carrera/estado` | Toggle state (stopped/moving) |
| POST | `/api/carrera/finalizar` | End the trip and return the total fare |
| GET | `/api/carrera/actual` | Get the live state and running total of the active trip |
| GET | `/api/historial` | Get today's trip history |

## 🔒 Security

Access is protected by a password, stored as a SHA-256 hash in `config/security.json` — no plaintext credentials are stored anywhere in the project.

## ✅ Testing
```
pytest
```

Covers the fare calculation logic (`Tarifa.calcular_coste`) across normal, edge, and zero-rate cases.

## 📝 Logging

All key actions (trip start/end, state changes, login attempts) are logged to `logs/taximetro.log` for auditability.

## 🗺️ Next Steps

This prototype validates the core concept. Future phases could include:

- **Multi-user accounts with role separation**: individual driver logins plus a fleet manager role, so trip history isn't tied to a single shared password
- **Integrated GPS**: automatic detection of stopped/moving state based on speed, removing the need for manual toggling
- **Centralized, extractable database**: a fleet-wide database the manager can query and export across all vehicles, not just one
- **Digital receipts**: emailed or printable receipts for passengers
- **Payment integration**: card/mobile payment support at the end of a trip
- **Admin dashboard**: a web panel for the fleet manager with aggregated stats across drivers and days
- **Push notifications**: alerts for the fleet manager (e.g. long idle periods, unusual fares)
- **Integration and end-to-end tests**: beyond the current unit tests for fare calculation, covering the full trip flow and API
- **Cloud deployment with CI/CD**: hosting the app centrally with automated testing and deployment on each change
